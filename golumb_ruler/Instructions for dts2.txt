Instructions for dts2

Dts2 reads input variables n, k, nt (3i5 format) from the terminal (unit 5).

    * n is the number of marks per ruler
    * k is the maximum length allowed
    * nt is the number of rulers 

Dts2 then finds all difference triangle sets consisting of nt rulers each having n marks and length at most k and with all differences distinct. Dts2 writes out the difference triangle sets as it finds them (up to a limit currently 10 determined by the nprint parameter) to the terminal (unit 6) and disk (unit 1). When it has completed the search it writes a summary to the terminal (unit 6). At this point the program may be given another search to do or be terminated by entering 0.

For example to find all golomb rulers with 13 marks and length 106 or less enter

   13  106    1

After a while dts2 will find a ruler

      0     7     8    17    21    36    47    63    69    81
    101   104   106

and then a bit later complete the search

 n= 13 k= 106 solutions=       1 time=           19.57 nodes=      49441242.

This may take a few hundred seconds on a slow machine. The program can now be terminated by entering

    0

At this point disk unit 1 should contain the following

        13       106         1
     0     7     8    17    21    36    47    63    69    81
   101   104   106
         0         0

If dtsver is now run it will read unit 1 and verify that this is a difference triangle set. It will write to the terminal (unit 6).

        13       106         1
         0         0         0
          1 difference triangle sets verified
